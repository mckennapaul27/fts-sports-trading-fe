# Risk Disclaimer

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Important Notice

**WARNING:** Sports trading and betting involve substantial risk of loss. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You should never risk more than you can afford to lose.

## General Risk Warning

Fortis Sports Trading provides information, analysis, and trading systems for educational and informational purposes only. We do not provide financial, investment, or gambling advice. Any decisions you make regarding sports trading or betting are entirely your own responsibility.

### Key Risks

1. **Capital Loss:** You may lose some or all of your capital when trading sports. There is no guarantee of profit, and losses can exceed your initial investment.

2. **No Guaranteed Returns:** While our systems are based on historical data and statistical analysis, there is no guarantee that past performance will continue. Markets are unpredictable, and no system can guarantee consistent profits.

3. **Market Volatility:** Sports betting markets are highly volatile and can be affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:

   - Team form and injuries
   - Weather conditions
   - Referee decisions
   - Market manipulation
   - Unexpected events

4. **System Performance:** Our trading systems are based on historical analysis and statistical models. They are not infallible and will experience losing periods. Drawdowns are a normal part of trading, and you should be prepared for extended losing streaks.

5. **Betting Exchange Risks:** Our systems are designed for use with betting exchanges (primarily Betfair). You should be aware of:

   - Exchange commission rates
   - Market liquidity issues
   - Potential account restrictions
   - Technical failures or delays

6. **Emotional Trading:** Even with systematic approaches, emotional decision-making can lead to poor results. Discipline is essential, and you should follow the system rules without deviation.
